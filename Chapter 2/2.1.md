# Chapter 2.1 Exercises

## 2.1: Better 'make-rat'

  make-rat can make rationals
  > (make-rat 1 2)
  > '(1 . 2)

  make a make rat than can handle negatives
  > (make-rat -1 2)
  > '(1 . -2)

    (define (make-rat n d)
       (if (or (or (> n 0) (> d 0)) (or (> 0 n) (> 0 n)))
           (cons (abs n) (abs d))
         (if (and (< n 0) (> d 0)
              (cons (abs n) (- 0 d))
            (cons n d))))))

## 2.2: Line Segments in a pair
  ; provided
  (define (print-point p) (newline)
  (display "(") (display (x-point p)) (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

  ; my code

  (define make-point cons)

  (define (make-segment p1 p2)
  (cons p1 p2))

  (define (x-point n)
  (car n))

  (define (y-point n)
        (cdr n))

  (define (mid-point p1 p2)
  (display (/ (+ (x-point p1) (x-point p2)) 2))
  (newline)
  (display (/ (+ (y-point p1) (y-point p2)) 2)))

  (define eee (make-point 1 1))
  (define eeee (make-point 4 4))

  (mid-point eee eeee)

## 2.3: Regtangles in lists

  (define make-point cons)

  (define (make-segment p1 p2)
    (list p1 p2))

  (define (x-point n)
  (car n))

  (define (y-point n)
        (cdr n))

  (define (make-rect ws hs)
    (list ws hs))
  (define (make-rectangle l1 l2 l3 l4)
    (list l1 l2 l3 l4))
  (define (width rect)
  (let ((seg (car rect)))
        (let
          ((x1 (x-point (car seg)))
          (x2 (x-point (car (cdr seg)))))
        (abs (- x1 x2)))))
  (define (height rect)
  (let ((seg (car (cdr rect))))
        (let
          ((y1 (y-point (car seg)))
          (y2 (y-point (car (cdr seg)))))
        (abs (- y1 y2)))))

  (define (area rect)
    (* (width rect) (height rect)))
  (define (perim rect)
    (+ (* 2 (width rect)) (* 2 (height rect))))

  Sample rectangles:
    (define w (make-segment (make-point 1 4) (make-point 4 4)))
    (define w2 (make-segment (make-point 4 4) (make-point 4 1)))
    (define h (make-segment (make-point 1 1) (make-point 1 4)))
    (define h2 (make-segment (make-point 1 4) (make-point 4 4)))
    (define rect (make-rect w h))
    (define rect2 (make-rectangle w h w2 h2))

## 2.4: Alternate cons, cdr, and car
  Provided new alternates:
    (define (cons x y)
      (lambda (m) (m x y)))
    (define (car z)
      (z (lambda (p q) p)))
  These work returning a procedure than does this:
    > (define n (cons 1 2))
    > (lambda (m)
        (m 1 2))
    > (car n)
    > (lambda ((lambda (p q) p))
          (m 1 2))
    > 1
    Cons creates a closure that applies a lambda that returns the first or second argument given to it on the cons's pair.


    My own alternative cdr

    (define (cdr a)
      (a (lambda (p q) q)))

## 2.5: Nonnegative pairs with cons, cdr, and car
  (help needed)
  Use 2^a3^b to represent pairs
  So if you divide a number as many times as the exponent used on one of it's
  factors, you will get that number.

  (define (pow b n)
    (if (= n 0)
      1
    (* b (pow b (- n 1)))))

  (define (cons a b)
    (* (pow 2 a) (pow 3 b)))

  (define (car n)
    (define (iter count divd)
      (if (= (mod divd 2) 0)
          (iter (+ count 1) (/ divd 2))
          count))
          (iter 0 n))

  (define (cdr n)
    (define (iter count divd)
      (if (= (mod divd 3) 0)
          (iter (+ count 1) (/ divd 3))
          count))
          (iter 0 n))

## 2.6: Lambdas that return lambdas that return more lambdas
  (help needed)
  Procedure that does something once, then leaves.
    (define (one n)
      (lambda (f)
        (n f)))
  Same thing, but for two.
    (define (two n)
      (lambda (f)
        (n (n f))))

## 2.7: Lower Bound Upper Bound
  (define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))

  (define (lower-bound x)
    (min (car x) (cdr x)))

  (define (upper-bound y)
    (max (car x) (cdr x)))

## 2.8: Difference of 2 Intervals
  (define (sub-interval a b)
    (make-interval (- (upper-bound a) (upper-bound b))
          (- (lower-bound a) (lower-bound b))))

## 2.9: Proove width is just addition or subtraction
  So, let's get the width of two intervals, and then subtract and add it to find out. Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.

    (define (width i)
      (/ (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i)) 2))

    => (width (add-interval (make-interval 6.4 1.4) (make-interval 9.2 3.2)))
    => 5.5
    => (+ (width (make-interval 6.4 1.4)) (width (make-interval 9.2 3.2)))
    => 5.5

    Not true for division or multiplication:

    => (width (div-interval (make-interval 9.2 3.2) (make-interval 6.4 1.4)))
    => 3.0357142857142856

    => (* (width (make-interval 6.4 1.4)) (width (make-interval 9.2 3.2)))
    => 7.499999999999999

## 2.10: Test cases for Alyssa P. Hacker's interval division
  (define (div-interval x y)
    (if (eq? (sub-interval x y) (cons 0 0))
        (display "error: your intervals are the same distance")
    (mul-interval x
      (make-interval (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                     (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y))))))
