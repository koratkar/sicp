# Chapter 2.1 Exercises

## 2.1: Better 'make-rat'

  make-rat can make rationals
  > (make-rat 1 2)
  > '(1 . 2)

  make a make rat than can handle negatives
  > (make-rat -1 2)
  > '(1 . -2)

    (define (make-rat n d)
       (if (or (or (> n 0) (> d 0)) (or (> 0 n) (> 0 n)))
           (cons (abs n) (abs d))
         (if (and (< n 0) (> d 0)
              (cons (abs n) (- 0 d))
            (cons n d))))))

## 2.2: Line Segments in a pair
  ; provided
  (define (print-point p) (newline)
  (display "(") (display (x-point p)) (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

  ; my code

  (define make-point cons)

  (define (make-segment p1 p2)
  (cons p1 p2))

  (define (x-point n)
  (car n))

  (define (y-point n)
        (cdr n))

  (define (mid-point p1 p2)
  (display (/ (+ (x-point p1) (x-point p2)) 2))
  (newline)
  (display (/ (+ (y-point p1) (y-point p2)) 2)))

  (define eee (make-point 1 1))
  (define eeee (make-point 4 4))

  (mid-point eee eeee)

## 2.3: Regtangles in lists

  (define make-point cons)

  (define (make-segment p1 p2)
    (list p1 p2))

  (define (x-point n)
  (car n))

  (define (y-point n)
        (cdr n))

  (define (make-rect ws hs)
    (list ws hs))
  (define (make-rectangle l1 l2 l3 l4)
    (list l1 l2 l3 l4))
  (define (width rect)
  (let ((seg (car rect)))
        (let
          ((x1 (x-point (car seg)))
          (x2 (x-point (car (cdr seg)))))
        (abs (- x1 x2)))))
  (define (height rect)
  (let ((seg (car (cdr rect))))
        (let
          ((y1 (y-point (car seg)))
          (y2 (y-point (car (cdr seg)))))
        (abs (- y1 y2)))))

  (define (area rect)
    (* (width rect) (height rect)))
  (define (perim rect)
    (+ (* 2 (width rect)) (* 2 (height rect))))

  Sample rectangles:
    (define w (make-segment (make-point 1 4) (make-point 4 4)))
    (define w2 (make-segment (make-point 4 4) (make-point 4 1)))
    (define h (make-segment (make-point 1 1) (make-point 1 4)))
    (define h2 (make-segment (make-point 1 4) (make-point 4 4)))
    (define rect (make-rect w h))
    (define rect2 (make-rectangle w h w2 h2))
